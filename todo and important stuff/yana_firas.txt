 Error text:
Loading class `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'. This is deprecated. 
The new driver class is `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver'.
 The driver is automatically registered via the SPI 
 and manual loading of the driver class is generally unnecessary.

Sun Oct 08 10:52:20 EEST 2017 WARN: Establishing SSL 
connection without server's identity verification is not recommended.
 According to MySQL 5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+ requirements SSL 
 connection must be established by default if explicit option isn't set. 
 For compliance with existing applications not using SSL the 
 verifyServerCertificate property is set to 'false'. 
 You need either to explicitly disable SSL by setting 
 useSSL=false, or set useSSL=true and provide truststore for server certificate verification.
